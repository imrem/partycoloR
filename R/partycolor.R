#' Get colors of parties
#'
#' Returns the colors of parties
#' @param ids A single id or vector of ids from the Party Facts data set.
#' @param type The color model the colors should be in, can be hex, rgb, cmyk, or all (if all three types should be returned).
#' Default is hex.
#' @param websafe logical: should web safe colors be returned instead? Old browsers were not able to display
#' other colors than these, with current browsers this option should not be necessary, default is FALSE.
#' @param include_ids logical: should party facts ids be included in the output? If the colors get added to an existing data
#' frame that already has the ids this is usually not helpful, default is FALSE.
#' @param include_description logical: should the name of the color (e.g. "Dark blue") be included in the output? 
#' Default is FALSE.
#' @param include_source logical: should the data source of the color be included in the output? Can be wikidata or
#' wikipedia, default is FALSE.
#' @param include_multiple logical: in some cases parties have multiple party colors, in these cases only one of them
#' is included in this data set. Should information on whether the party has multiple colors according to the source, 
#' default is FALSE.
